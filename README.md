# YAML to JSON Converter

This is a Python program that converts YAML files to JSON files. It supports conversion of all `.yml` and `.yaml` files in the root directory of the project.

Instead of uploading your sensitive .yaml files to an unknown site, you can gather all yaml files in the root directory and run the program to generate the matching .json files.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyYAML

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/LironJit/yml-json-converter.git`
2. Install PyYAML: `pip install pyyaml` or alternatively `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory in a terminal/command prompt.
2. Run the program: `python yml_to_json.py`
3. The program will find all `.yml` and `.yaml` files in the root directory and convert them to `.json` files.

## Example

Suppose you have the following YAML files in the root directory of your project:

- data.yml
- config.yaml

After running the program, you will have the following JSON files:

- data.json
- config.json
